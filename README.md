# MathsTutotrial_For_4-5YearOld
Aim: To design an interface that can teach mathematics to children of 4-5 years age.
Theory:
In this experiment, as we know, our direct users are going to be younger children in the age range of 4-5. Hence the platform should be completely compatible to the thinking process of such children and buttons should be intuitive to them. Let us evaluate our direct clients on the following criteria.
i)	Analysis of children behaviour e.g. their preferences or interests:
As our clients are children, let us dive into their likings or interests. We know that children are extremely fond of candies or chocolates or lollipops. These objects attract them towards something. We also have observed that children are attracted towards different colours and associate a colour with a functionality. And we know that children like to fidget with things, hence buttons will play an important role.

ii)	What kind of interfaces will they like and why?
As discussed above, now we know their preferences. So let us make an interface that compliments their preferences. The interface should be a fairly open and uncrowded interface. It should be colour coded in a way to be clearly identify which blocks are buttons and which are not. The interface should have some sound associated with it for fun and interaction. The interface should have objects that a typical child will be attracted to. The interface shouldn’t have anything to type but just buttons to press as we are trying to match a 5 year old child’s intellect. The colours used in the interface should be bright so as to look attractive to kids.

iii)	Analysing Existing apps and rating them:
While going through some existing applications of the same purpose, it was observed that, though they had made a simple application, it was not intuitive and inviting. There was sound involved but no fun or interaction with it. A lot of important buttons had text on it rather than images which becomes difficult for kids. The color scheme used was nice and bright, which is a plus point. And overall rating for such an app can be a six on ten as it isn’t as intuitive as it should be for a 5 year old to use.  
	
iv)	Choice of screen elements:	
The screen is mostly going to have buttons in a specific color code. It is going to have images for attraction and interaction. On hovering over specific objects a sound is embedded in the interface for grater interactive learning. We have selected lollipop as our primary functional object as children like lollipop. By clicking on the lollipop icon the counter start increasing. Hence there are 2 lollipop icons as addition and subtraction are binary operators. The operator sign in between, when clicked generates the output.


v)	How is this app better than existing:
This application is more intuitive than other apps. It has a consistent user interface and is color coded for functionality retention. The user has a good control over buttons. The app is flexible in terms of going back to original state. The app is more interactive than other apps as it involves sounds and images. Overall the learning experience will be better and more fun.
